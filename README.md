# CPTS455-HA3
**Specifications:**  
Create a client-server app using sockets. The client-server app should facilitate instant message type chat functionality wherein messages sent from a client terminal should be visible on the server terminal and vice versa. The app should also support file shares between the client and server terminals. The client-server app interface can be either graphical or textual. This activity can be performed in any programming language, as preferred by the student. Python maybe more beginner friendly.

**Description:**  
Client-Server application that supports instant messaging and file transfer between a single client and server. Uses multithreading to support simultaneous functionality. 

**Files:**
* server.py (server-side program)
* client.py (client-side program)
* medium.txt (sample text file)

**Instructions**  
In the terminal start server.py: ```python server.py```  
In a separate terminal start client.py: ```python client.py```  
Begin typing messages to send between client and server. Use "file" keyword to initiate a file transfer between client and server or vice-versa.
